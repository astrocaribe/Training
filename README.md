Training Repository
====================

Repository for STScI Training
-----------------------------

This repository contains the scripts necessary for completing the  
training modules for several topics. Each topic will have its own  
folder, with all relevant scripts contained therein. The scripts  
themselves solve or answer exercises contained in the training  
manuals. The manuals will not be included in the repositories;  
only the scripts will be placed here so they exist outside of the  
context of the actual exercises.
